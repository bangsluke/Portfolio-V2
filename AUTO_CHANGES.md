## 2024-12-19 16:15 - Carousel UI Improvements

### Problems Fixed:
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Removed type indicator badges ("Company"/"Client") from carousel items
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Improved date formatting to show date ranges in MMM YYYY format
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Enhanced date logic to show "Current" for ongoing relationships

### Changes Made:
- Removed type indicator badges from both carousel cards and modal popups
- Updated date processing to show date ranges: "Jan 2024 - Dec 2024"
- Added logic to show "Jan 2024 - Current" for ongoing relationships
- Improved date formatting using `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', year: 'numeric' })`
- Enhanced date validation to handle empty, null, and "TBD" values

### Date Logic:
- **With start and end dates**: Shows "Jan 2024 - Dec 2024"
- **With start date only**: Shows "Jan 2024 - Current"
- **No dates or invalid dates**: Shows nothing
- **Handles "TBD" and empty strings**: Treated as no end date

## 2024-12-19 16:10 - Clients Content Schema Validation Fix

### Problems Fixed:
- **config.ts**: Fixed content schema validation error for clients with array linkedCompany values
- **Dorkinians FC.md**: Client file with array linkedCompany and logoURL field was causing validation failure
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Updated to handle linkedCompany arrays and logoURL for clients

### Root Cause:
The clients collection schema expected `linkedCompany` to be a string, but some client files (like Dorkinians FC.md) have it as an array. Also, some client files use `logoURL` instead of `imageURL`.

### Changes Made:
- Updated clients collection schema to allow `linkedCompany` as string, array, or null
- Added `logoURL` field to clients schema as alternative to `imageURL`
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to handle linkedCompany arrays
- Enhanced processing logic to convert linkedCompany arrays to comma-separated strings
- Updated CompanyCard component to handle logoURL for clients

### Technical Details:
- `linkedCompany` can now be: `string`, `string[]`, or `null`
- Array values are converted to comma-separated strings for display
- Clients can use either `imageURL` or `logoURL` for background images
- Processing logic handles both field variations seamlessly

### Result:
- ✅ Content validation errors resolved for clients
- ✅ All client files can be processed successfully
- ✅ Carousel handles both imageURL and logoURL for clients
- ✅ Linked company arrays are properly displayed as comma-separated strings
- ✅ No impact on existing functionality

## 2024-12-19 16:05 - Content Schema Validation Fix

### Problems Fixed:
- **config.ts**: Fixed content schema validation error for companies with null logoURL values
- **P3.md**: Company file with empty logoURL field was causing validation failure

### Root Cause:
The companies collection schema expected `logoURL` to be a string, but some company files (like P3.md) have empty or null logoURL values, causing validation errors.

### Changes Made:
- Updated companies collection schema to allow `null` values for `logoURL` field
- Changed from `z.string().optional()` to `z.union([z.string(), z.null()]).optional()`
- This allows companies to have either a string logoURL or null/empty values

### Technical Details:
- Content collections in Astro validate frontmatter against defined schemas
- Empty frontmatter fields are interpreted as null values
- Schema must explicitly allow null values using `z.union([z.string(), z.null()])`
- This fix ensures all company files can be processed regardless of logoURL values

### Result:
- ✅ Content validation errors resolved
- ✅ All company files can be processed successfully
- ✅ Carousel continues to filter companies with valid logoURL values
- ✅ No impact on existing functionality

## 2024-12-19 16:00 - CustomerAndClientCarousel Enhanced with Clients

### Problems Fixed:
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.astro**: Added support for both companies and clients in the carousel
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Updated to handle different data schemas for companies vs clients
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Added visual distinction between companies and clients with type badges
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Enhanced modal to show linked company information for clients

### Key Differences Between Companies and Clients:
- **Companies**: Use `logoURL` field, slug-based names, `companyDescription`
- **Clients**: Use `imageURL` field, explicit `name` field, `clientDescription`, `linkedCompany`

### Changes Made:
- Updated Astro component to fetch both companies and clients collections
- Combined and sorted both types by date (newest first)
- Added type indicators (blue badge for companies, green badge for clients)
- Enhanced modal to show linked company information for clients
- Updated fallback colors (blue gradient for companies, green gradient for clients)
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for both data types

### Technical Details:
- Companies and clients are filtered to only include those with images/logos
- Combined list is sorted by dateStart with alphabetical fallback
- Type badges help users distinguish between companies and clients
- Modal shows additional linked company information for clients
- Different fallback gradients provide visual distinction

### Result:
Carousel now displays both companies and clients with:
- ✅ Visual type indicators (Company/Client badges)
- ✅ Different fallback colors for each type
- ✅ Proper handling of different image field names
- ✅ Linked company information for clients
- ✅ Unified sorting and display logic

## 2024-12-19 15:45 - CustomerAndClientCarousel Fixed

### Problems Fixed:
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.astro**: Added `client:load` directive to TypeScript component to enable client-side hydration
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Removed all debugging code and restored clean production version
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.astro**: Removed debug elements and console logs for production
- **CustomerAndClientCarousel.tsx**: Enabled Flicking carousel by default with proper endless scrolling

### Root Cause:
The TypeScript component was not hydrating on the client side because it was missing the `client:load` directive in the Astro component. This caused the component to only render on the server without any client-side interactivity.

### Changes Made:
- Added `client:load` directive to `<ClientAndCustomerCarousel>` component in Astro
- Cleaned up all debugging code and console logs from both components
- Restored production-ready carousel with Flicking library enabled
- Maintained data cleaning to ensure optimal JSON payload size

### Technical Details:
- `client:load` directive enables server-side rendering + client-side hydration
- Flicking carousel now provides endless scrolling with auto-play functionality
- Company cards display with logo backgrounds, hover effects, and modal details
- Carousel automatically cycles through companies every 3 seconds

### Result:
CustomerAndClientCarousel now works perfectly with:
- ✅ Server-side rendering for SEO
- ✅ Client-side hydration for interactivity  
- ✅ Endless scrolling carousel with Flicking
- ✅ Company cards with logo backgrounds and hover effects
- ✅ Modal popup for detailed company information

- Added `.mint-link` CSS class to `global.css` with mint green styling
- Used CSS classes instead of inline styles for better maintainability
- Applied consistent mint green theming: `#31d69a` with `#6ce9b7` hover

### Styling Applied:
