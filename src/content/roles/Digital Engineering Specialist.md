## Short Role Description

Technical Delivery Lead for an internal start-up branch within the company, architecting the digital infrastructure and agile processes required for the project lifecycle. Standardized global reporting by delivering a suite of internal tracking tools, significantly increasing Automotive project lifecycle visibility across the global business.

## Full Role Description

Initially started the role by developing a [[VBA]] script to loop through the created data list and generate hyperlinked and navigable [[PowerPoint]] slides showing workflows, whilst simultaneously generating [[Visio]] workflows and an exported PDF for mapping out a full Automotive workflow process for the development of a vehicle for an overseas customer.

From the work done and also through various other company influences, a new internal [[GPMO]] (Global Program Management Office) team was formed of which I was involved. This led to the development of several tools, under the [[GPMO]] domain, utilising technologies such as [[Power Apps]], [[Power BI]] and [[Excel]] to create a start-to-end process for a project lifecycle;

- [[Project Pipeline]]
- [[Pipeline App User Report]]
- [[Financial Tracker]]
- [[Financial Tracker Lite]]
- [[Cost Model]]
- [[Cost Model Translation File]]
- [[Project Finance Data Manager]]
- [[Project Finance Tracking Report]]
- [[Group Sales Report]]
- [[GPMO Reports]]
- [[GPMO Documentation Site]]

The role dropped me fully into a [[Product Management]] role, where I established the team's agile governance by implementing [[Azure DevOps]] from the ground up for all of the tools being developed. I managed sprints, whilst simultaneously supporting development of the tools and setting up the [[GPMO Documentation Site]] to ensure a high standard of documentation.

We ultimately delivered a fully synced system of tools that helped the company track and progress their project quotation and reporting process, bringing together the various regions of the company into a centrally aligned system, reducing manual error in their systems and saving hours of manual data collation.

## Key Achievement

The delivery of several [[Microsoft]] based tools that were used internally across the global business for managing projects and automating the financial reporting, drastically increasing operational visibility and reporting accuracy and saving days of manual collation work for each region.
