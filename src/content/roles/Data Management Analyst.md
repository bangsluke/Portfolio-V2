## Role Description

Joined an internal team in developing an automotive scalable development plan ([SDP](https://sdp.rle.de/#home)), initially defining a process in <p class="mint-link">Excel</p>, and then developing this into a web-based tool. I was responsible for collecting the data by interviewing experts within and outside the company and collating the data into a format that we could use algorithms to automatically develop a tailored timing plan for a customer.

Responsibilities also include supporting decisions on the architecture of the tool, design of the <p class="mint-link">UI</p> and managing the offshore developers in building and maintaining the tool.

The role has allowed me to begin writing code in a number of languages, from writing test files in <p class="mint-link">Java</p>, creating <p class="mint-link">Cypher</p> queries on our graph database, to developing a basic <p class="mint-link">React</p> app for providing support information to consultants using the tool.
