## Planning and Design

### AI Architecture Prompts

#### Remote Server Update Prompt

- List current setup
- List all current limitations

- I currently have an app, running with the following setup: the backend data is hosted in a Neo4j graph, specifically in a free Neo4j Aura database.
	- `generate_neo4j_graph_from_md.py` is a Python script that updates the Neo4j Aura graph. The connection is done via .env variables which are set up correctly. This script loops through my Obsidian MD files to grab the required tags and creates and connects the nodes together as per my defined schema.
	- The `remote-update-flask-api.py` opens up a `/generate-graph` endpoint for my existing backend server (stored in Heroku) at <https://server-mytraveljournal-be4d3e31032e.herokuapp.com/> - although this is not currently working
- I need to have an Apple Shortcut on my phone that I can run that triggers the `generate_neo4j_graph_from_md.py` file. It needs to warn me if I have no internet and email me if the script is triggered correctly, and if it fails. However, the Python script is slow (around 5 minutes) to update the Neo4j graph. When pushing from my laptop, I need it to be the laptop Obsidian files, but when pushing from my iPhone, need it to be the locally stored Obsidian files on my phone (not stored on iCloud but instead in the area "On My iPhone"
- Please provide step by step instructions to achieve my requirements and ask any questions that will help you

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

#### Flask API Setup

- I have a Neo4j database (local for development and Aura for production) full of data with a schema defined in schema.graphql in the front end. 
- How would I create a flask app that opens a server to read and update the Neo4j database? I need the data to be pushed from a certain folder if being triggered from my laptop and from another directory if pushed from my iPhone
- Please separate all Python schema generation into a separate file to the main run file

## Lessons Learned

Taught me about setting up a [[Flask]] server and opening up endpoints for data retrieval. Also taught me about how best to organise and manage [[Python]] code in a growing codebase given my past experience with [[Python]] had been for single script projects.

Also forced me into developing debugging documentation for myself after making the same mistakes twice and ensuring a third time never happened by writing a checklist for understanding why the backend server crashed.
