## Role Description

Joined an internal team in developing an automotive scalable development plan ([SDP](https://sdp.rle.de/#home)), initially defining a process in [[Excel]], and then developing this into a web-based tool. I was responsible for collecting the data by interviewing experts within and outside the company and collating the data into a format that we could use algorithms to automatically develop a tailored timing plan for a customer.

Responsibilities also include supporting decisions on the architecture of the tool, design of the [[UI]] and managing the offshore developers in building and maintaining the tool.

The role has allowed me to begin writing code in a number of languages, from writing test files in [[Java]], creating [[Cypher]] queries on our graph database, to developing a basic [[React]] app for providing support information to consultants using the tool.
