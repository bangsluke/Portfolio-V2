## Long Description

SDP - Scalable Development Plan - was an internal tool developed within [[RLE International]] that brought together the various automotive process knowledge that the company had gathered over years of work with various [[OEMs]].

It was a web application that gathered project inputs from users and could then calculate a full project timing plan, split across various swimlanes for the given project details. After this, users could further update the plan within the tool to fully align it to their own expectations or export the data for using in external tools such as [[Project|Microsoft Project]].

- Back end/Datasource: [[Neo4j]], [[Cypher]], [[01 Notes/02 Areas/Work Notes/Skills Notes/Languages/Java|Java]], [[SQL]], [[Excel]], [[VBA]], [[Google Sheets]], [[Google Apps Script]]

## Planning and Design

- The planning and design of the frontend was done before I joined the project as we mainly developed the later apps to match the styling of the initial prototype.

## Lessons Learned

I was fully in charge of the [[SQL]] backend database, meaning I had to learn how to write [[SQL]] queries. I optimised this by storing the data that we collected day to day in [[Excel]] and then writing a [[VBA]] script to automate creating the [[SQL]] queries to update the database quickly.

This lead to a complete rebuild when our company migrated from [[Microsoft]] to [[Google]], meaning I had to migrate the data and automations into [[Google Sheets]] and use [[Google Apps Script]].

There was a brief period where we began consider rebuilding the frontend in [[React]] and as such, I was involved in discussing the requirements and helping with the interview process, although the development of this stopped relatively quickly when the whole project was scaled back.

As well as the main app, we also developed several [[NeoDash]] dashboards off of the [[Neo4j]] data for ongoing maintenance to check on the data, teaching me about this tool and getting me further involved with writing [[Cypher]] queries.
