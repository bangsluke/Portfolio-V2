## Short Description

This personal portfolio website for displaying my past projects, experience and skills.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Long Description

An updated personal portfolio website for displaying my skills and past projects, building on my previous site with my newly learned skills.

Every project, skill, role, company, education and reference is stored in [[Obsidian]] [[Markdown]] notes, processed by [[Node.js]] scripts and loaded into the [[Astro]] site for display.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Architecture and Technologies

- Front end: [[Astro]], [[Preact]], [[Tailwind CSS]], [[Zod]]
- Back end/Datasource: [[Obsidian]], [[Node.js]]
- Hosting: [[GitHub]] and [[Netlify]]
- Security: [[Snyk]]
- Authentication: n/a
- Testing: [[Jest]]

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Repositories

- Main repo: `=this.codeURL`

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## PowerShell Query

To launch the repo, use the [[PowerShell]] alias

## Planning and Design

> See [Portfolio Site V2 - Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGwOxW7u4E/LWIzan4Iz-ywjKlt-wyYSQ/edit?utm_content=DAGwOxW7u4E&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) for the design

Create an updated Portfolio Website, in a similar style to the previous [[Portfolio Site]], but use [[Obsidian]] as the data source and load all data into my existing [[Neo4j]] graph for retrieval by the site. This will allow dynamic and on the fly updates to things such as skills updates, roles updates etc whilst creating a single source of truth in [[Obsidian]].

Add portfolio tag to indicate which project, company and technology/skill should be displayed.

Design initially started from a template project called [NeonMint](https://github.com/EFEELE/NeonMint).

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

### AI Recommended Architecture 

> See [[ChatGPT]] thread "Portfolio Site V2 Stack"

- Frontend: [[Astro]] or [[React]]
- Backend/API: [[Vercel]] Serverless Functions ([[Node.js]])
- Database: [[Neo4j Aura]] (cloud-hosted graph DB)
- Auth: Secured via [[Vercel]]'s Environment Variables

## Lessons Learned

Initially I set the project up with an [[Astro]] front end and started doing [[GraphQL]] calls to my [[Backend Server]] project to collect the portfolio data I had stored in the [[Neo4j]] graph. However I soon realized that I was undoing the speed of [[Astro]] and switched to a script that loads the required portfolio data (stored in [[Obsidian]] [[Markdown]] files) into the portfolio repo and used [[Astro]] collections to gather and display the data that way.

The project taught me about defining [[npm]] functions in the `package.json` file and how to pass variables through to these scripts using the `cross-env` package.

It was also my first taste of [[Tailwind CSS]] and although I began to grasp the utility class names towards the end of development, I found it easier in a lot of situations to extract a class and define it in the main [[CSS]] file. I see it's benefits for fast prototyping, but I'm not a big fan from what I've seen.
