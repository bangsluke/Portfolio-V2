# Zapier

> [!back] Link back to [[Skills Notes]]

> Zapier is a no‑code automation platform that connects thousands of apps so you can move data between them and automate repetitive tasks. It lets you build workflows called _Zaps_ that trigger actions across tools like [[Gmail]], [[Slack]], and [[Google Sheets]] without writing any code, helping individuals and teams streamline processes and save time.
