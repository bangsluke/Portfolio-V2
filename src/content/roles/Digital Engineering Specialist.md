## Role Description

Development of online web-based applications for automotive problems. Following a couple of months of 1:1 mentoring with a senior developer, I have developed an MVP dashboard tool, built using <span class="theme-link">Next.js</span>, <span class="theme-link">Nest.js</span>, a <span class="theme-link">Neo4j</span> database and a <span class="theme-link">Flask</span> <span class="theme-link">API</span> to call a <span class="theme-link">Python</span> algorithm. The tool collects inputs from a user, calculates several optimal <span class="theme-link">DVP</span> plans and then presents the options in several ways to enable further user decisions.
