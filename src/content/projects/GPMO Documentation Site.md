## Short Description

A full documentation site for all tools developed by the [[GPMO]] team, using [[Docusaurus]] and static [[Markdown]] files maintained by the tool developers.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Long Description

The documentation behind all [[GPMO]] processes and tools, helping users and future developers understand how to use and update data and the tools themselves.

Maintained by the tool developers, the site is built using [[Docusaurus]] which collates the documentation written in [[Markdown]], with special components written in [[React]] to provide extended functionality beyond the available [[Docusaurus]] features.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me how to integrate [[React]] components into a [[Docusaurus]] site - as previously I had only built sites using the core [[Docusaurus]] functionality.

I also had to investigate into our company's [[Azure]] set up to ensure the site was accessible by internal employees only and set up a custom domain to make the site easier to find for users.

We also utilised the blog feature of [[Docusaurus]] to provide regular [[GPMO]] updates to the company which was a new feature for me to work with.
