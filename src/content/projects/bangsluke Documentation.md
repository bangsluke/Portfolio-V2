## Short Description

A personal documentation site storing key links to the software I use, articles I find useful, and a section on [[Dorkinians FC]] stats. The repo also contains my [[Homepage Website|Homepage]] and [[New Tab Website|New Tab]] pages.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Long Description

Broken out into several sections, my documentation site provides me top level links to key softwares and guides me through each project, from planning, installation and set up to develop, testing and deployment. It also holds details on the [[Dorkinians FC]] stats and how to maintain them - for handover to others.

I regularly keep it updated with new links and processes I find so that it remains relevant to the work I am doing.

Outside of the documentation section, the repo also contains my [[Homepage Website|Homepage]] and [[New Tab Website|New Tab]] pages as the whole repo is hosted through [[GitHub]] pages.

## Lessons Learned

This project introduced me to the concept of documentation sites, the ease and brilliance of [[Markdown]] and led me to notice how many different softwares either use [[Docusaurus]] or a very similar type static site builder for their documentation.
