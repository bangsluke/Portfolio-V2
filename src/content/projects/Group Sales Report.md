## Lessons Learned

The key functionality for the graphics was developed by [[Alex Sheers]] on this report. My role was the navigation between pages and usability.

I learned how best to develop images for use as page and button backgrounds in [[Figma]] to get pixel perfect images and help separate the content of each page into distinguishable sections to aid readability.
