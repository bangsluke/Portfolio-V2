## Introduction

A note detailing the work I did on an online [DVP](#dvp) planning tool for [RLE International](#rle-international).

Worked on this with [Elena Kohlwey](#elena-kohlwey) and [Kevin Tim Gruner](#kevin-tim-gruner).

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Short Description

The [DVP](#dvp) project was a short demonstration of using [Neo4j](#neo4j) graphs for running optimisation calculations for the Automotive industry.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Long Description

[RLE](#rle-international)â€™s [DVP](#dvp) tool was a working demonstration tool for how problems such as automatically generating a vehicle [DVP](#dvp) could be done from inputs and running optimisation algorithms to generate a Pareto curve of the importance of each input.

## Architecture and Technologies

- Front end: [React](#react), [JavaScript](#javascript), [Next.js](#next.js)
- Back end/Datasource: [Neo4j](#neo4j), [Cypher](#cypher), [Java](#01-notes/02-areas/work-notes/skills-notes/languages/java)
- Hosting: [GitLab](#gitlab) (see [Repositories](#repositories))
- Security: n/a
- Authentication: [Azure](#azure)

## Repositories

- Main repo: `=this.codeURL`
- Secondary repo: n/a

## PowerShell Query

To launch the repo, use the [PowerShell](#powershell) alias 

> `=this.powerShellAlias`

## Planning and Design

- The main template of the frontend was a Berry Material [UI](#ui) template

## Other Links

- TBC - add link to the GitLab top level project?

## Lessons Learned

The lessons learned for me were mainly in data visualisation in the front end, as I received various data points from the backend [Neo4j](#neo4j) and [Java](#01-notes/02-areas/work-notes/skills-notes/languages/java) calculations and had to plot the results on a 3D graph to best demonstrate the tradeoffs between results, allowing the user to select the floating 3D point and see the data inputs behind its generation.

It also taught me a lot about passing large objects of states from one page to the next.
