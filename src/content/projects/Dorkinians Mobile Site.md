A quick access, mobile friendly filterable stats site for [[Dorkinians FC]] players.

## Long Description

After creating the initial [[Dorkinians Website]], I would regularly be asked by players “But how many goals were just in cup games/not friendlies/just league?” Etc etc.

I therefore decided to play around with creating a filterable site so that players could answer these questions themselves.

## Lessons Learned

This project let me design my first filter [[UI]] popup using [[React]] and taught me methods of filtering the data received from the back end.

I also tried out a new [[API]] method of retrieving data to the front end from [[Google Sheets]], using their available method instead of parsing generated [[CSV]] data like I did on the [[Dorkinians Website]].
