## Short Description

A fast navigation page for my laptop and mobile to take me to my most used links and sites along with some useful widgets.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Long Description

The project has a [[Node.js]] set up to extract the `Links List` data from this [[Obsidian]] note and copy it into the repo. A lightweight fast vanilla [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]] set up then reads in the links and produces the site.

The site also has a couple of useful widgets such as a weather forecast and The Premier League table for seeing how [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] are doing.

## Planning and Design

Initial planning began on 12/02/2026, drafting the initial requirements.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

### Initial Prompt

Create me a tab that is my new tab page. It should be optimised for speed, ready to direct me to my next destination quickly.

The top of the page should have the text "Welcome **@bangsluke** to your new tab.". The background of the site should be the "bg.jpg" file that is in the "assets" folder and should fill the screen.

The list of links to display needs to fetched from a local computer file - which has it's path stored in the config.yaml, in the property "links-list-source-file-path". From this markdown file, extract the markdown table below the header "Links List".

Display the list of links, in the order defined in the table, grouping items under category headers. If the item has a logo URL, display that as a small circular logo before the link to the site.

If the item has an Umami Tracking Link - then add a link to the Umami dashboard after the link name, but also do an API call to the umami project and gather the number of visitors that have visited the site in the last 24 hours and compare it to the number of users to visit the site in the previous 24 hours before that - indicating an upwards green triangle if trending up and a downward red triangle if reduced.

For the list of links, add a search bar above the list that the user can type into to filter the list. Do it as a fuzzy search so that it picks up spelling mistakes and ensure the search includes the link name and grouping.

Implement a weather forecast widget for the next 24 hours conditions and 7 day weather based on the users current location.

At the bottom of the page, have a minimalist footer that shows "[© 2026-TBC bangsluke designs.](https://github.com/bangsluke/bangsluke)  [Mail Icon](mailto:bangsluke@gmail.com)" where the TBC is dynamically whatever year it currently is. And instead of the text Mail Icon, use an icon of an envelope.

In the bottom right corner of the page, add a circular floating action button that appears after scrolling down 10% of the height of the page and when clicked or touched on mobile, jumps the user back up to the top of the page.

Ensure that the page has a modern stylish feel

As part of your plan, also ideate any cool additional features that the site could have on it.
