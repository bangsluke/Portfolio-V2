## Short Role Description

Joined a small team in developing a scalable timing plan web-based tool for automotive projects ([[SDP]]). Collected data from field experts to generate a full development plan for the automotive process and developed a solution for maintaining a [[Neo4j]] database via a custom-built [[Excel]] sheet to store the collected knowledge.

## Full Role Description

Joined an internal team in developing an automotive scalable development plan ([[SDP]]), initially defining a process in [[Excel]], and then developing this into a web-based tool. I was responsible for collecting the data by interviewing experts within and outside the company and collating the data into a format that we could use algorithms to automatically develop a tailored timing plan for a customer.

Responsibilities also include supporting decisions on the architecture of the tool, design of the [[UI]] and managing the offshore developers in building and maintaining the tool.

This was my first step into [[DevOps]], where I managed feature requests and guided the developers through implementing improvements for users.

The role has allowed me to begin writing code in a number of languages, from writing test files in [[Java]], creating [[Cypher]] queries on our graph database, to developing a basic [[React]] app for providing support information to consultants using the tool.
