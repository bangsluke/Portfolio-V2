## Short Description

A website to show details of my travels across the world.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Long Description

A visualisation and analysis of the travelling I have done, providing descriptions of my trips and a level of analysis on top of this such as most visited places, most common travel companions and other stats.

## Ideas & Design

### Ideas

- Use [Docusauras](https://docusaurus.io/) or Docify
- Load md files from Travel notes through a script to populate the site
- Use the [[Obsidian]] graph and have [[Neo4j]] queries running on the graph using [[GraphQL]]
- Have a count of key tags, e.g. count number of country tags there are for number of places visited
- Have a timeline component that shows the holidays plotted on a linear scale
- Add a chatbot to the site that allows a user to chat to the database. Write a statement such as "How many times has [[Kieran Mackrell]] been on holiday with [[Luke Bangs]]?" and then the text is identified into a cypher query and sent to the database and returns the answer. Should display the generated cypher query for debugging purposes. Get the chatbot front end visuals from the customer tool I made with Dom.
	- Not sure this is possible unless I am able to find a way to use a [[OpenAI]] API call to create a [[GraphQL]] query in the client
	- <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/directives/>
- Add back to top Floating Action Button on all pages
- Add a heading per page in the below style. Add tags to holidays in the same style as the below bubbles for things such as “skiing”
- Use suspense in [[React]] for loading faster - [Efficient and Elegant Web Development with Next.js: A Deep Dive into Component Streaming and Chunked Transfer Encoding | by Momen Daoud | Nov, 2023 | Medium](https://medium.com/@momendaoud/efficient-and-elegant-web-development-with-next-js-6087b3fd86e1)

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

### Travel Note format

- Have all meta data in the front data of each note;
	- Attendees
	- Cover Photo
	- Location (City, Town or County etc)
	- Departing airport (set default if set as Unknown)
	- Have a Boolean value in the meta data about if to load into the graph or not (elevate to folders somehow maybe)
- Link back to Travel home
- Can get date from title

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

### Planned Pages

#### Home Dashboard 

- At the very top, have some big text about travel or adventure 

![[20231115 Website Inspiration 3.jpeg]]

- Top of the page, show the world map
- Initial card list of holidays and descriptions below it
- Clicking on a holiday jumps to that holiday page
- Have a show more at bottom of list to only load a few in originally 
- Click a button on each card to make it full screen? Or just transition to the holiday page via animation where the card grows to fill the page 

![[20231009 TravelWebsitePageLayoutSketch.jpeg]]

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

#### Sidebar

- Have on left of the screen
- When toggled, have it come in from the left and change the colour of the logo in the top left corner from white to a red version of the same logo
- Have the page links look like the headers on each page with a / before each
- For the sidebar, always have visible for desktop but have as appearing on mobile 

![[20231009 SidebarInspiration.jpeg]]

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

#### Holiday Page

- For each holiday, have a separate page where it shows
	- An image of the holiday 
	- A distance travelled to get to that holiday - from the departingAirport unless set as n/a
	- A list of clickable attendees 
- Make the holiday image fill the entire screen, including removing the page header, like below
- Only the header text and back button remain, as bold white over the image

![[20231115 Website Inspiration 1.jpeg]]

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

#### World Map Visualisation 

- Find a full screen map that colours countries based on if I've been there or not
- Best component will also colour darker if I've been more than once
- Add date filters to limit the data
- Clicking a country will jump to the [[Travel Website#Country Page|Country Page]]
- Have the map greyed out like below with coloured tag markers to be visually in line with current red and white theme Of the site

![[20231009 MapIconInspiration.jpeg]]

- Have key numbers below the map as shown below

![[20231009 MapStatsInspiration.jpeg]]

- Possible libraries
	- [Home | React Google Maps](https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/)
	- <https://github.com/stellasia/neomap>
	- [React Simple Maps (react-simple-maps.io)](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/)
	- [yanivam/react-svg-worldmap: A simple, compact and free React SVG world map. (github.com)](https://github.com/yanivam/react-svg-worldmap)

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

#### Neo4j Graph Visualisation 

- Allow users to pan around and zoom into the graph like in [[Neo4j]]
- Allow users to click on nodes to jump to other pages
- Kevin to send link to visualiser
	- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/vis-react>
	- <https://medium.com/neo4j/15-tools-for-visualizing-your-neo4j-graph-database-ff7315873032>

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

#### Person Page

- Show how many holidays I've been on with that person
- List what locations and countries I've been to with that person

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

#### Country Page

- [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries) - [[API]]
- Show the flag of the country
- Show all locations connected to that country
- Show how many times I've been to that country
- Show who I've been to that county with (a list of clickable people)

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

#### Location Page

- Show the country the place is in
- Add a Google Maps url link to it?
- Show how many times I've been to that location
- Show who I've been to that location with (a list of clickable people)

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

### Planned Features

- Highly connected set of pages
	- [[GraphQL]] - [Pass variables in call](https://youtu.be/YBP-waKYbnA?si=DYmKIROE3_uS1N_s)
- Use slugs for urls to create links between pages
	- [[Next.js]] - [Next.js Dynamic Routes](https://youtu.be/Ql5kyJaYbls?si=WE8sp-XLz5ASo8Pd)
- Have common layout component between pages 
	- [Simple Next.js Layout Tutorial](https://youtu.be/DGn25s42NvQ?si=b-hBV_gHT4rJCLRy)
	- [[Next.js]] - [Layouts turorials](https://youtu.be/zbYBgy_ChGY?si=Anh6wL8ZjB8758B7)
- Create reusable components such as a attendees list that is fed props such as an object of attendees names, ids and the slug to their page to create quick hyperlinks
- In the header, have a back button with a simple [[JavaScript]] back code (see Big Lynn 404 page) to get back to any previous page

## Lessons Learned

The biggest challenge for this project was setting up the [[Apollo]] backend server and getting the connection to the front end.

I also learned a lot about the page routing in [[Next.js]] to develop the various page types on the site.
