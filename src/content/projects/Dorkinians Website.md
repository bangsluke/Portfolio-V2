## Long Description

A sports stats site for displaying performance data for [[Dorkinians FC|Dorkinians FC]] players and teams, my local [[Football|football]] club which I play for. What initially started as an [[Excel]] spreadsheet with stats posted on our club WhatsApp each week was the perfect opportunity for me to try and develop into my first real public website. I even wrote a [Dev article](https://dev.to/bangsluke/building-a-stats-website-for-a-sports-club-4g5m) explaining how I built the stats site.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me several things:
- Retrospectively taught me the importance of components for reusability for long term maintainability. All of this project was built within a single [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]] file (and [[CSS]]) before I knew how to work properly with components, meaning everything is copied out and manually edited over and over again, making maintenance a nightmare
- Reviewing the speed of the website through analysis tools helped me learn I need to reduce the number of [[HTML]] elements in the future by being smarter and more efficient in components
- Taught me that parsing a [[CSV]] using the method I used is too slow for large amounts of data, especially when the data continues growing. The project needs to be rebuilt faster with a new method
- Allowed me to learn how to work with [[SVG]] files used as the images on the TOTW page
- Helped me creatively come up with ideas to keep users engaged whilst data was loading, leading to the various random humorous quotes I have appearing on the main loading screen
All of the above led me to begin work on [[Dorkinians Website V3]] to overcome the problems listed above.
