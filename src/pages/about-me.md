TBC<br><br><h2>My Beginnings in Programming</h2><br><br>Iâ€™ve been interested in computers since a young age, enjoying learning by clicking around and exploring the full functionality of tools such as <span class="theme-link">Microsoft</span> Office programs, although it was only in my first job role after university that I began to enjoy coding.<br><br>My Automotive degree had made me touch on using Matlab in one semester but Iâ€™d only used it to pass the course rather than enjoying it. <br><br>But starting at <span class="theme-link">RLE</span> set me into a role where I began writing <span class="theme-link">VBA</span> scripts for improving the functionality of <span class="theme-link">Excel</span> tracking documents for engineers. It was simple enough code, but I quickly fell in love with having the ability to produce documents that simplified engineers jobs and reported out useful metrics to management.<br><br>Talk about Dorkinians excel sheet<br><br>Alongside my job which transitioned into engineering instead of software development, at the start of 2021 I decided to teach myself web development, teaching myself through online sources. <br><br>I've always been an organised person, but software has helped me elevate that to another level. Nowadays I have a digital life organised and structured in a consistent fashion across various softwares, with daily automations integrated throughout from providing me morning email summaries of my finances and travel route to work, to mobile shortcuts to push health data to an online file.<br><br>Talk about:<br>- Starting with VBA<br>- Teaching myself to code in 2021<br>- My set up today<br><br><h2>My Career Path Explained</h2><br><br>My career started in Automotive Engineering, with my first role as <span class="theme-link">Project Support</span> allowing me to automate through coding, but after that the companies needs necessitated that I moved to the customers office location and take up a <span class="theme-link">Body Panels & Closures Project Engineer</span> role instead.<br><br>During my time as a project engineer I gained experience working with a wide range of materials and manufacturing techniques including injection moulding plastics, hand lay-up composites, compression moulding composites, forging metals and die casting metals. I have implemented these processes to support both high volume and prototype build phases and have hands on build experience during launch. I have been responsible for writing and maintaining Technical Specifications, Design Validation Plans and DFMEAs for the systems I owned. Trained in MATLAB, Siemens Teamcenter PLM and SAP, with reviewer training in NX Unigraphics and Catia V5.<br><br>However, after five years of working as an engineer across a number of OEMs, I found myself in a developing software team, building software tools (<a href="/portfolio/projects/sdp" class="theme-link">SDP</a> and a new <a href="/portfolio/projects/dvp-tool" class="theme-link">DVP Tool</a>) to support Automotive processes. Luckily this has allowed me many opportunities to develop my coding interests.<br><br>In early 2024, I made the decision to travel the world with my wife and was given a sabbatical for a year to head off and explore from August 2024 to September 2025. It was a simply unforgettable experience, travelling over 82,000 kilometers and visiting 19 countries across 9 months.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AKxdBiC.png" alt="External Obsidian image"><br><br><br> I've built several projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with further experience in React, Next.JS and Node.JS. I have database experience using MySQL and Neo4j with GraphQL calls to return data. Experienced with an extended range of Microsoft programmes, including Visual Basic Application. <br><br><h2>Building This Site</h2><br><br>Initially I had an old portfolio site (<a href="/portfolio/projects/portfolio-site" class="theme-link">Portfolio Site</a>) which was my first attempt at building a website to showcase my work and abilities. The site was vanilla <span class="theme-link">HTML</span>, <span class="theme-link">CSS</span> and <span class="theme-link">JavaScript</span> and used hardcoded <span class="theme-link">CSV</span> and <span class="theme-link">JavaScript</span> files in the repo to store the details of my skills, as well as having the projects written individually in the <span class="theme-link">HTML</span> file.<br><br>I quickly realised I wanted a more maintainable site, where I didn't need to manually update several sources to get the website updated. Given I was already storing notes about my life in my <span class="theme-link">Obsidian</span> vault, I decided I wanted to use that as my data source as an easy means of updating data, either on my laptop or on the go from my mobile.<br><br>Therefore I defined a schema in my notes, defining different note types (projects, companies, references etc) and how they would be connected to one another (a project may have a linked company for example).<br><br>As I already had a working project using a <span class="theme-link">Neo4j</span> graph database as a backend (<a href="/portfolio/projects/travel-website" class="theme-link">Travel Website</a>), I extracted my set up from that project, and created a new <a href="/portfolio/projects/backend-server" class="theme-link">Backend Server</a> project to host the data in <span class="theme-link">Neo4j</span>. I then extended the server to hold both travel and portfolio data by updating a <span class="theme-link">Python</span> script I had for extracting the required notes from my <span class="theme-link">Obsidian</span> vault, storing both data types in the same graph with a label property to differentiate them.<br><br>After setting up an <span class="theme-link">Astro</span> site to retrieve the data via <span class="theme-link">GraphQL</span> calls, I realised I was l was losing the benefits of <span class="theme-link">Astro</span>'s approach, making every component client side retrieve the information for display. As such, I pivoted my approach, disconnecting the <a href="/portfolio/projects/backend-server" class="theme-link">Backend Server</a> and migrating the site to copy over and process the <span class="theme-link">Obsidian</span> <span class="theme-link">Markdown</span> files into a content folder in the repo and use <span class="theme-link">Astro</span>'s collection feature to read the processed data into the site, gaining me the website speed I had desired when choosing it as a framework. <br><br><h2>Side Projects </h2><br><br>I've been told that I need to have a side project to be happy<br><br>I'm interested in developing a few personal projects on the side. I started out with a fun web page for my mates, building on our competitive nature and creating a site that ranks each of us at various sports and skills. Most recently I've launched a stats website for my amateur football club (<a href="/portfolio/projects/dorkinians-website" class="theme-link">Dorkinians FC</a>), allowing players to see their performance stats such as minutes played, goals and assists etc. on which I've written a briefÂ articleÂ on Dev.<br> <br>><a href="https://dev.to/bangsluke/building-a-stats-website-for-a-sports-club-4g5m" class="theme-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dev | Building a Stats Website for a Sports Club</a><br><br>I'm an active member of a town football club of 8 menâ€™s teams, involved in organising and helping develop the growing club base. In my spare time, I have created and maintained a statistics document for the club which reads data directly from the FA website, displays the playerâ€™s statistics on a self-designed web page and outputs infographics for social media, based on team and player performances.<br><br><h2>What's Next... ðŸš€</h2><br><br>I don't regret my decision to initially go into Automotive. It was a fascinating and thrilling set of roles that gave me incredible opportunities for travel and to work for several prestigious companies, and the skills I learned as an engineer translate well into where I want to go. But I'm now keen to find a challenging role in software in a workplace with creative room to support my strength of innovative problem solving.<br><br>I am interested in taking on a challenging role to further develop my own skills, inherit a greater level of responsibility and work for a company I can be passionate about growing. I am a quick leaner, keen to understand new processes and programs and understand the reasoning behind each step. My inquisitive nature pushes me to logically apply my knowledge to solve complex technical problems as efficiently as possible.<br><br>I consider myself to work strongly and positively in a team environment, easily able to adapt to both the roles of leader or member when required. I am able to listen to other views, take on suggestions, motivate colleagues and resolve differences between members to maximise a team's efficiency.<br>
