## Short Role Description

Collaborated on the delivery of '[[SDP]]', a scalable web-based timing platform for automotive project management. I acted as the translation layer between field experts and the developers - gathering the automotive domain knowledge and architecting a solution for storing the data in an [[SQL]] and [[Neo4j]] database via a custom-built [[Excel]] sheet for user familiarity.

## Full Role Description

Joined an internal team in developing an automotive scalable development plan ([[SDP]]), initially defining a process in [[Excel]], and then developing this into a web-based tool. I was responsible for collecting the data by interviewing experts within and outside the company and collating the data into a format that we could use algorithms to automatically develop a tailored timing plan for a customer.

Responsibilities also include supporting decisions on the architecture of the tool, shaping the [[UI]]/[[UX]] and hiring and managing the offshore developers to ensure smooth delivery.

This was my first step into [[Product Management]], where I managed feature requests and guided the developers through implementing improvements for users, ensuring a continuous feedback loop between end users and the development team. 

The role allowed me to begin writing code in a number of languages, from writing test files in [[Java]], fixing [[C++]] files, creating [[Cypher]] queries on our graph database, to developing a basic [[React]] app for providing support information to consultants using the tool.
