## Full Role Description

After re-locating to the customer's location, I assumed a larger number of responsibilities including the delivery of an engineered automotive solution for a new super series car dihedral door system. I worked directly with several suppliers, managing budgets and delivery plans from development phase into prototype build.

A range of responsibilities for individual components and assemblies including the delivery of engineered automotive solutions from development phase into prototype build. Creation and development of DFMEA's, Tech Specs and DVPs for the systems worked on. Direct interaction with suppliers, working through concept development and feasibility to visiting the manufacturing lines to ensuring timing was maintained and looking for cost down opportunities.

Gained experience working with a range of materials and manufacturing techniques including injection moulding plastics, compression moulding composites (SMC) and die casting metals.

Involvement in prototype build phase, learning both rapid production and manufacturing processes with hands on build experience during launch.
