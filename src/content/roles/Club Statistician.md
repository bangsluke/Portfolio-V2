## Full Role Description

I started the voluntary role shortly after beginning to play for the club when I noticed that team statistics weren't collected, and after asking around, developed my own [[Excel]] based solution for gathering stats and then producing an output graphic using [[VBA]] that could be sent out to the club weekly after games.

After teaching myself web development in early 2021, I began to extend the statistics further, migrating into [[Google Sheets]] and then building a basic [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]] website, the [[Dorkinians Website]], on top of the data - through a process I explained in this [Dev article](https://dev.to/bangsluke/building-a-stats-website-for-a-sports-club-4g5m).

The site was a hit with club members and led to me winning a couple of internal club awards for my efforts.

I took a step back from the role and handed over the regular statistic updating responsibilities in July 2024, but continue to maintain the online website.
