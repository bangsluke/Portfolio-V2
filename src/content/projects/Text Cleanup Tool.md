## Short Description

A simple terminal run automation to clean up some input text and output [[Markdown]] into a format I've defined to work best with my documentation or [[Obsidian]] notes.

## Long Description

A [[Python]] automation that when run from the terminal, opens up a small GUI to allow the user to input a block of text - usually generated by an [[LLM]] and then tidy up the style, format and characters to work within a defined range of rules to match my desired [[Markdown]] formatting for either documentation or [[Obsidian]].

## Planning and Design

- All planning was done via [[Claude Code]] to generate a `requirements.md` file that lives in the repo.

## Lessons Learned

The key lesson learned here was my approach to planning the requirements of the tool. I used [[Claude Code]] to iteratively define the requirements of the tool, describing the outcome I wanted and build the [[PRD]].

I then utilised other [[LLM]]'s via [[Cursor]] to review and critique the requirements, encouraging them to find flaws and contradictions in the plan until we had a clear specification for the build, which was incredibly straightforward from that point.
