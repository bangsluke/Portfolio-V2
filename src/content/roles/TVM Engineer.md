## Full Role Description

Development of lightweight rear closure door hinges to replace a high-volume multinational OEM's overly complex design for a weight (2kg) and cost saving (lifetime saving of over $8m). Steel cast hinges incorporated with a new check arm design that became common across all commercial vehicle variants. Durability action to D-Pillar structure to tackle ongoing production issues.

Cross-continental implementation in three production plants achieved through managing multiple supply chain costs and timing. Continued interaction with suppliers to find cost down opportunities, functionally test the designed system and improve assembly processes for enhanced part quality.

Ongoing progression of other cost saving changes, taking ideas from concept to implementation across V362 & V363.
