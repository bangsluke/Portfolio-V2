## Role Description

Development of online web-based applications for automotive problems. Following a couple of months of 1:1 mentoring with a senior developer, I have developed an MVP dashboard tool, built using [Next.js](#next.js), [Nest.js](#nest.js), a [Neo4j](#neo4j) database and a [Flask](#flask) [API](#api) to call a [Python](#python) algorithm. The tool collects inputs from a user, calculates several optimal [DVP](#dvp) plans and then presents the options in several ways to enable further user decisions.
