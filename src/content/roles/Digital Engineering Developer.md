## Full Role Description

Following a couple of months of 1:1 mentoring with a senior developer, I developed an [[MVP]] dashboard tool, built using [[Next.js]], [[Nest.JS]], a [[Neo4j]] database and a [[Flask]] [[API]] to call a [[Python]] algorithm. The tool collected inputs from a user, calculates several optimal [[DVP]] plans and then presents the options in several ways to enable further user decisions.

The tool was used as a demonstration of how the team could solve automotive problems using a mathematical approach called multiple-objective optimisation via an algorithm written in [[Python]] which the tool passes and receives data to/from via a [[REST]] [[Flask]] [[API]].
 
This tool served as gathering internal company buy-in, successfully demonstrating how technical automation could replace manual planning cycles and reduce lead times for testing strategies.

## Key Achievement

Developed a full-stack [[MVP]] to validate a multi-objective optimization approach, successfully securing stakeholder buy-in for automated planning strategies.
