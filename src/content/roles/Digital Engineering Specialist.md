## Short Role Description

Became [[DevOps]] lead for a new internal branch within the company, known as [[GPMO]], managing and supporting the development of a wide range of internal tracking tools throughout a project's lifecycle.

>[!top] [Back to top](#Table%20of%20Contents)

## Full Role Description

Started the role by developing a [[VBA]] script to loop through the created data list and generate hyperlinked and navigable [[PowerPoint]] slides showing workflows, whilst simultaneously generating [[Visio]] workflows and an exported PDF for mapping out a full Automotive workflow process for the development of a vehicle for an overseas customer.

From the work done and also through various other company influences, a new internal [[GPMO]] (Global Program Management Office) team was formed of which I was involved. This led to the development of several tools, under the [[GPMO]] domain, utilising technologies such as [[Power Apps]], [[Power BI]] and [[Excel]] to create a start-to-end process for a project lifecycle;

- [[Project Pipeline]]
- [[Pipeline App User Report]]
- [[Financial Tracker]]
- [[Financial Tracker Lite]]
- [[Cost Model]]
- [[Cost Model Translation File]]
- [[Project Finance Data Manager]]
- [[Project Finance Tracking Report]]
- [[Group Sales Report]]
- [[GPMO Reports]]
- [[GPMO Documentation Site]]

The role dropped me fully into a [[DevOps]] role, where I created the development process and set up the [[Azure]] [[DevOps]] system we used for all of the tools. I became [[DevOps]] lead, managing sprints whilst simultaneously supporting development of the tools.
