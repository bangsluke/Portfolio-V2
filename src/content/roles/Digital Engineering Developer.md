## Short Role Description

Creation of an online web-based [[MVP]] application for taking inputs from users and generating a set of optimal [[DVP]] plans, to prove out the teams mathematical multiple-objective optimisation approach.

## Full Role Description

Following a couple of months of 1:1 mentoring with a senior developer, I developed an [[MVP]] dashboard tool, built using [[Next.js]], [[Nest.js]], a [[Neo4j]] database and a [[Flask]] [[API]] to call a [[Python]] algorithm. The tool collects inputs from a user, calculates several optimal [[DVP]] plans and then presents the options in several ways to enable further user decisions.

 The tool was used as a demonstration of how the team could solve automotive problems using a mathematical approach called multiple-objective optimisation via an algorithm written in [[Python]] which the tool passes and receives data to/from via an [[API]].

## Key Achievement

Development of a full stack application web-based tool to demonstrate the team's mathematical solution.
